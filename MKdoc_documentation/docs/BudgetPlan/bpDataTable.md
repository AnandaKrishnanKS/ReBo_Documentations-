##**BpDataTable**

- BpDataTable.tsx

BpDataTable is component in OTB table folder which exports function BpDataTable() with destructured props columns, data, setData and loading coming form otb controller parent component,
```typescript
 const { body, setBody } =React.useContext(BpContext);
const [rowSelection, setRowSelection] =React.useState({});
const [columnVisibility, setColumnVisibility] =
React.useState<VisibilityState>(nonDefaultColumns);
const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] =React.useState<ColumnFiltersState>([]);
const [sorting, setSorting] =React.useState<SortingState>([]);
```
this code is used to handle states and display a table of data with a search bar and pagination. The component is highly customizable and can be used to display a variety of different types of data.
```typescript
  consttable=useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    state: {
      sorting,
      columnVisibility,
      rowSelection,
      columnFilters,
    },

    meta: {
      updateData: (rowIndex:number, columnId:string, value:string) => {
        setData((old:any) =>
          old.map((row:any, index:any) => {
            if (index===rowIndex) {
              return {
                ...old[rowIndex], [columnId]:value,
              };} returnrow; }));},},
```
`const table = useReactTable({ ... }):` This line initializes a React Table instance using the useReactTable hook. It takes an object with various configuration options as its argument.

data: This is likely an array of data that you want to display in your table. It represents the rows of your table.

columns: This is an array of column definitions for your table. Each object in the columns array likely defines properties like Header (the column header title) and accessor (a function that specifies how to access data for that column from each row).

state: This property holds the initial state for your table. It includes settings like sorting, column visibility, row selection, and column filters. These settings control the initial behaviour and appearance of your table.

meta: This property is an object containing metadata and callbacks related to your table.

updateData: This is a callback function that is likely used to update the data in your table. It appears to update a specific cell's value at a given row and column. It takes three parameters:

rowIndex: The index of the row you want to update.

columnId: The identifier of the column you want to update.

value: The new value to set for the specified cell.

Inside the updateData function, it seems to update the data state using the setData function, which is not shown in your provided code but is likely a React useState hook to manage the table's data. It uses the map function to iterate over the existing data array and create a new array with the updated value for the specified cell.

This code represents the setup for your React Table component, and it appears to be part of a larger component or application. You would typically render your table UI and handle user interactions using this configuration. If you have more specific questions or need further assistance with this code, please provide additional context or specific questions.
```typescript
 useEffect(() => {

    const_sort=JSON?.stringify(table?.getState()?.sorting[0] ?? {});
    const_body_sort=JSON?.stringify(body?.sort);
    if (!(_sort===_body_sort) &&Object?.keys(body)?.length) {
      setBody((s:any) => ({...s,
        fetch_from_db:false,
        table_changes: {},
        sort:table?.getState()?.sorting[0] ?? {},
      })); }}, [table?.getState().sorting]);
```
This code is a React useEffect that monitors changes to the sorting state of a table component and updates the body state accordingly;

`useEffect(() => { ... }, [table?.getState().sorting]);:`

This useEffect hook is triggered whenever there's a change in the sorting state of the table object. It depends on the table?.getState().sorting value.

`const _sort = JSON?.stringify(table?.getState()?.sorting[0] ?? {});:`

Here, _sort is a variable that stores a JSON string representation of the first sorting configuration in the table component's state. If there are no sorting configurations, it defaults to an empty object {}.

`const _body_sort = JSON?.stringify(body?.sort);:`

This line creates a JSON string representation of the sort property in the body object. The body object is assumed to contain some state related to the table.

`if (!(_sort === _body_sort) && Object?.keys(body)?.length):`

This condition checks if _sort (the current sorting configuration in the table) is not equal to _body_sort (the sorting configuration stored in the body state), and if the body object has at least one key (i.e., it's not empty).

Inside the condition:

It updates the body state by creating a new object ({ ...s } where s is the current state).

It sets fetch_from_db to false, indicating that there's no need to fetch data from a database.

It resets the table_changes property to an empty object.

It updates the sort property in the body state with the current sorting configuration from the table component.
