##**BpTablePagination**

- BpTablePagination.tsx

It uses the useContext hook to access data from the BpContext, which likely contains state information related to the data table and its pagination.
```typescript
  const { body, setBody, webSocketData } =useContext(BpContext);
  
  consttotalElements=webSocketData?.data?.length?webSocketData?.items:0;

  consttotalPage=Math.ceil(totalElements/body?.page_size);
```
This code calculates the totalElements, representing the total number of data elements available from the webSocketData. If there is no data available, it defaults to 0.

It calculates the totalPage by dividing the totalElements by the current number of rows per page specified in body.page_size. This value represents the total number of pages needed to display all the data elements based on the chosen page size.

In summary, this code snippet retrieves data from the context, calculates the total number of elements and pages based on that data, and stores these values for use in the pagination controls displayed by the DataTablePagination component.

The code generates a user interface for paginating data in a table, including options to change the number of rows per page and navigate through different pages of data. The behavior of these controls is tied to the body state and context provided by the BpContext.
